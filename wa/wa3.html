    <p>The planet Saturn got its name from the Roman god of wealth and agriculuture. Similarly to the planet Jupiter, which formed
        around the same time, it is also heavily influenced and associated to Greek mythology.
        It has been in existence for about 4.5 billion years. It is said that the Romans named Saturday after Saturn</p>

    <p>Unlike a majoority of planets, Saturn is composed mainly of gasses. Its core is potentially
        the only solid part of it. That being said, the core would also be the densest part about it,
        the rest of it is considered to be less dense than water. Saturn also has layers of clouds that
        are not visible unless seen from up close. It's most known feature, the rings, are composed mainly of ice
        with some parts of debris and dust particles. They extend from 4,120 to 75,000 miles outward from Saturn's
        equator.

    <p>It was thanks to Galileo's observance of Saturn appearing "not as round as the moons on Saturn's side",
        and Christiaan Huygens who looked at Saturn using a telescope with higher magnification that its
        rings were discovered in the first place. If we were to observe Saturn here from Earth, we would see just the
        main shape, but no rings.</p>
    <p>Saturn's core maintains more heat (21,150 degrees Fahrenheit) than the exterior, which remains cold (-280 degrees Fahrenheit)</p>
    <p>Saturn has about 82 discovered moons. It is very possible that there are still more left to be discovered.</p>
